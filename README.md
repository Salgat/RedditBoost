## Feedback and contributions
This project uses Gitflow so a feature branch and pull request to the develop branch are necessary if you want your feature pulled in. Additionally, this project follows a simplistic and clean commit style of the format "Action Very Short Summary" with a more thorough description following the commit title. Actions allowed are "Add, Remove, Update, Refactor, and Fix" all in the present tense. Any failure to follow this format will result in the pull request being rejected.
